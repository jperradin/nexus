Features
========

Nexus-CAT provides a wide range of features for cluster analysis in atomistic simulations. Below is an overview of the key features:

### Cluster Analysis

- **Average Cluster Size**: Calculate the average size of clusters in the system.
- **Biggest Cluster Size**: Identify the largest cluster in the system.
- **Spanning Cluster Size**: Exclude percolating clusters and calculate the largest remaining cluster.

### Percolation Properties

- **Gyration Radius**: Measure the spatial extent of clusters.
- **Correlation Length**: Calculate the correlation length of clusters.
- **Percolation Probability**: Determine the probability of clusters percolating in 1D, 2D, or 3D.

### Extensibility

- Customize cluster connectivity criteria and polyhedra.

### Visualization

- Generate detailed output files for further analysis.
- Export cluster positions and properties for visualization.
