# Introduction

Welcome to the Nexus-CAT Python package documentation. Nexus-CAT is a **Cluster Analysis Toolkit** designed for analyzing clusters in atomistic simulation data, with a strong focus on percolation theory.

It is particularly well-suited for researchers working with molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo (MC) simulations who need to characterize clusters, aggregates, and networks in disordered materials such as glasses and amorphous solids.

### Project Goals

The goal of Nexus-CAT is to provide a user-friendly, efficient, and flexible toolkit for researchers working with trajectories of various systems. It supports multiple clustering strategies for analyzing different systems and cluster connectivities, and provides a comprehensive set of percolation and structural analysis metrics.

For a detailed overview of available clustering strategies and analysis tools, see the [Features](features.md) page.
